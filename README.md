Welcome to Amber's Liri Command Line App
~ My Liri App is trying to solve knowing the ratings of a movie, featured artist on a song, when the artist is performing a concert in town, and searches for your favorite song.
~ The main file interface is LIRI.js which takes in process.argv arguments., the user would need their own .env API key files to connect.
~ Technologies used was Axios to search for artist bands in town and omdb Api for movies. Spotify Api to search for music data. 
~ Liri bot is an app that helps that Spotify's songs for users, titles of their favorite artist, play the song of their favorite artist match concert dates to them locally as well as movies for their favorite actors.
~ How you would run the node app is that,  1. You would git clone this repository, 2. CD into the repository folder 3. Run NPM install 4. Run the following commands concert this, spotify this, do what it says. Or movie this. Followed bye the name of the movie. 
~ I also added a little user experience touch to it. If user request the name of a unidentifiable song, LIRI will play for the first 12 seconds "Sorry You're Not My Kind Of Girl " by New Edition. ( Just to Lighten the load ). Ha!
~ My role in the app developement was being the creative director as well as coding.
